        <h1>$ about me</h1>
        <h3>$ why i like programming</h3>
        <p>
            i started coding at about age six when my mum signed me up to a coding class.
            at the time, i didn't really know what 'coding' was, my only exposure to the
            concept was through a videos i'd seen about a certain programmable lego set.
        </p>
        <p>i was a bit disappointed when there was no lego.</p>
        <p>
            it turned out we were learning something called "scratch". our first project
            was to make old scratch cat run forwards and backwards across the screen. it
            took about an hour to drag out 5 blocks, but i was pretty impressed. so i
            continued with the coding classes despite the lack of cool lego robots. i
            told my parents i was really enjoying it, and i soon had a hand-me-down
            macbook air so i could keep learning to code at home. i ended up finishing
            our projects in about the first 10 minutes of the beginner classes, but i
            enjoyed helping others out. i could not get enough of this 'coding' thing and 
            soon i was enrolled in the beginner, intermediate, and advanced classes, and 
            was actively sharing my creations (or just stupid memes) on scratch. we learned
            javascript (just the p5js module) in the advanced class, which was just me and
            a few other nerds.
        </p>
        <p>
            eventually though, they stopped running the advanced classes, and then covid hit
            and i stopped entirely. i continued to use scratch even though i was probably
            too old for it, and looking back i mainly just made strange memes and skits.
            motivation was low starting high school, and i officially quit scratch on the
            6th of may, 2022. probably for the better, i wasn't learning anything! i 
            did try to learn python about once a year since maybe age 10, but i never really
            progressed until late 2023, when i started learning python again with my cousin,
            @SparKali on github.
        </p>
        <p>
            and that brings us to the current day - i am ok at python but constantly
            improving. i plan to do a computer science/general science double degree once i
            finish school.
        </p>
        <p>
            i would like to thank <a href="https://www.code4fun.com.au/">Code4Fun</a> and
            all my nerdy coding teachers for introducing me to this world of computer stuff.
